# Project Agents Charter

## Mission

- Deliver the personal architecture portfolio strictly following the steps defined in `execution-plan.md`.
- Preserve the plan locally only; never stage or commit `execution-plan.md`.
- Maintain clarity of architectural intent across UX, content, and infrastructure layers.

## Collaboration Principles

- Document rationale for non-trivial decisions directly in PR descriptions or commit messages.
- Prefer small, incremental changes aligned to a single issue from the execution plan.
- Keep communication artifacts (issues, tasks) bilingual-friendly: Portuguese titles with concise English summaries when possible.

## Branching & Commits

- Work on short-lived branches named `feature/<milestone>-<issue>`.
- One commit per plan issue with message format `feat: <Milestone>.<Issue> <short summary>`.
- Before merging, rebase onto `main`, run lint/tests, and ensure clean `git status`.

## Coding Standards

- Stack: Astro + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript when authoring components.
- Enforce dark-first design (Slate/Zinc 900 background, Indigo/Violet primary accents).
- Use semantic HTML, accessible headings hierarchy, ARIA labels for interactive elements, and keyboard-visible focus rings.
- Organize UI pieces under `src/components`, layouts under `src/layouts`, and routed pages under `src/pages`.

## Styling & Design System

- Define typography tokens for `Inter` (body) and `JetBrains Mono` (technical headings/code).
- Centralize Tailwind customizations in `tailwind.config.mjs` using CSS variables for color ramps.
- Favor utility classes for alignment/spacing; extract `@apply` rules only for repeated complex patterns.

## Content Guidelines

- Bio and hero copy must emphasize architectural strategy, not generic development.
- Case studies follow `Problema → Solução Arquitetural → Resultados`.
- Skills grouped by capability layers: Cloud, Backend, DevOps, Observability.

## Infrastructure & DevOps

- Containerize using multi-stage Dockerfile (builder + lightweight Nginx runtime).
- Provide `.dockerignore` mirroring `.gitignore` plus build artifacts and secrets.
- Deploy via Dokploy on Hostinger VPS; document DNS, SSL, and pipeline steps.

## Testing & Quality

- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before any commit.
- Target Lighthouse scores ≥ 90 for Performance and Accessibility; log evidence in PR notes.
- Favor WebP/AVIF assets; load heavy resources lazily.

## Documentation

- Keep `README.md` updated per milestone with setup, deployment, and architecture diagram (`User -> Cloudflare (DNS) -> VPS (Dokploy Proxy) -> Docker (Nginx + Site)`).
- Add changelog snippets under a "Milestones" section summarizing delivered issues.

## Security & Secrets

- Never commit API keys or credentials; use Dokploy secrets for runtime configuration.
- Restrict CORS and security headers via Nginx config in Docker image.
